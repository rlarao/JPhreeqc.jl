In the following, I will briefly describe what I used to do in the lab and later implement a preliminary structure and functions for the simulation of those steps."

    "This definition is useful in modeling but is not the most convenient one for the experimentalists, although it is possible for them to convert their protocol to the above definition. Moreover, sometimes we might change the composition of the seawater by mixing it with other solutions. Again, it is possible to do the calculations for the mixing process in, e.g. Excel, but it is more convenient to have a general function in our software. This functionality is already implemented in Phreeqc and we only need to expose it to the user. However, the creation of solutions by dissolving salts in water, although doable in Phreeqc, is not convenient and straightforward. Therefore, we have implemented the following functions in our prototype:"
